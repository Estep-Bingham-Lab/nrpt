# `nrpt`

***A NumPyro implementation of Non-Reversible Parallel Tempering (NRPT)***

## TODO

- Capture samples
- LogZ estimate
- Measure time elapsed in round 
- (perhaps related to the above) Rename the `PTStats` to `PTRecorders` and
organize its entries into sub-recorders depending on their purpose.
